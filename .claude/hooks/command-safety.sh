# description: On harnesses that execute hooks, refuse shell tool command text matching COMMAND_SAFETY_DENY_PATTERN from project settings. An absent setting applies the shipped host-safety pattern, which refuses a systemd-run memory cap measured in kilobytes or megabytes; an explicit `^$` turns matching off, while unreadable input or settings warn and allow the call. Matching starts at executable command positions, and does not inspect the desktop or running processes.
# summary: Applies the project deny pattern at executable command positions. Ordinary quoted arguments and proven simple data-reader here-documents pass; grouped data readers can warn or refuse on guarded text.
# safety: Advisory reader: dependency or payload failures warn once and allow the call. Executable command matches retain exit 2. The commit-guards command-position reader selects command words and masks quoted data and proven simple data-reader here-document bodies. A grouped data reader can warn or refuse when its body holds guarded text. This is a lexical check; assembled command names and unknown launcher option forms are outside its contract. Every diagnostic starts with command-safety: <key>=<value>.

# Every line this hook writes, and the only place its text lives. The first
# line is the contract a reader parses, `command-safety: <key>=<value>`: a
# stable key for the condition and the value acted on — the missing tool, why
# the payload could not be read, the state of the project policy, or the exit
# status of a check that did not complete. The English explanation follows it.
# The keyed line stands first, at position 1. What a command this hook runs
# wrote is captured where the hook reads it and passed here as the cause, so
# it is replayed under the key rather than ahead of it.
# The EXIT trap below calls this, so the whole message is one group that
# cannot carry a failure out: a write that fails there would leave with the
# writer's status rather than the refusal's, which the harness runs past.
