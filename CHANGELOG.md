## Unreleased

- **review-gate (breaking, consumer CI):** the `approval-sweep.yml` template
  now requests `issues: write` (previously `read`) for the sustained-failure
  escalation step's rolling incident issue. Consumers adopting the updated
  scaffold must grant the permission — or drop the escalation step to stay on
  `issues: read`.
