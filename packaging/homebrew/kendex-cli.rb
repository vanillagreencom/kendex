# Homebrew formula for the kendex CLI on its own. Lives in the tap
# `vanillagreencom/homebrew-kendex` as `Formula/kendex-cli.rb`, installed
# with:
#
#   brew install vanillagreencom/kendex/kendex-cli
#
# The plain `kendex` name belongs to the cask, so the default install is
# the app, which carries the command itself; this formula is the CLI-only
# channel. Installs the prebuilt release binary — no toolchain needed.

  version "1.0.1"
  # 1.0.0 follows 5.0.1, so the version number restarts. brew compares
  # this scheme before the number: an installed 5.x sits on scheme 0 and
  # reads as outdated, so `brew upgrade` reaches it. The Arch recipes
  # carry `epoch=1` for the same transition. Never lower it.

  # Materializing a catalog shells out to git, and kendex refuses on
  # anything below 2.41 — the first that takes `--attr-source`. A
  # formula dependency carries no version, so the floor itself is
  # left to that refusal; brew's own git is well past it.
