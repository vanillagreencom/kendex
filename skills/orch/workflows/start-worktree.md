# Start Session Workflow (Worktree)

Expedited session start for worktree contexts. Skips issue selection, preparation, and worktree creation — completed in the prior main-repo session.

## Inputs

| Command | Flow |
|---------|------|
| `start` (from worktree) | § 1 → § 2 → § 3 → § 4 → § 5 |
| `start [ISSUE_ID]` (from worktree) | § 1 → § 2 → § 3 → § 4 → § 5 |

---

## 1. Initialize Worktree Session

**Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/initialize.md § 1-2 → § 2` with context:
- `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
- `issue_id`: from argument or branch

---

## 2. Delegate to Specialist Agent(s)

1. **Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/dev-start.md § 1-4 → § 2 step 2` with context:
   - `worktree`: [WORKTREE_PATH]
   - `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
   - `issue_id`: [ISSUE_ID]

2. **Parse return**: Branch, Commit, QA Labels, Summary.

3. **Do NOT shutdown dev agent.** Persists for § 3 fix cycles and re-delegation. Only § 5.5 shuts it down.

→ § 3

---

## 3. Run Review Cycle

**Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/review-pr.md § 1-11 → § 4` with context:
- `worktree`: [WORKTREE_PATH]
- `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
- `dev_agent`: `[DOMAIN_AGENT]` from § 2
- `issue_id`: `[ISSUE_ID]`

---

## 4. Submit PR

1. **Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/submit-pr.md § 1-7 → § 5` with context:
   - `worktree`: [WORKTREE_PATH]
   - `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
   - `issue_id`: `[ISSUE_ID]`

---

## 5. Finalization

### 5.1 Reconcile Fixes Against Existing Issues

**Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/fix-reconcile.md § 1-9 → § 5.2` with context:
- `issue_id`: [ISSUE_ID]
- `pr_number`: from § 4

### 5.2 Post Summary & Handoff Comments

**Invoke workflow**: `⤵ workflows/post-summary.md § 1-3 → § 5.3` with context:
- `worktree`: [WORKTREE_PATH]
- `lifecycle`: `"managed"`
- `issue_id`: [ISSUE_ID]
- `pr_number`: from § 4

### 5.3 Move Linear Issue To In Review

**Do NOT mark issues Done.** Issues stay "In Review" until merge triggers Done.

1. **Resolve tracker**:
   ```bash
   TRACKER=linear; [[ "[ISSUE_ID]" == issue-* ]] && TRACKER=github
   ```

2. **Skip if** `TRACKER=github` (GitHub issues close via PR merge keywords). → § 5.4

3. **Move to review**. After PR submission, bot/CI review, fix reconciliation, and final comments are complete, move the managed Linear issue into review ownership:
   ```bash
   .agents/skills/linear/scripts/linear.sh issues update [ISSUE_ID] --state "In Review"
   ```

→ § 5.4

### 5.4 Output Session Summary

1. **Read final state**:
   ```bash
   CYCLES=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] .cycles)
   FIXED_COUNT=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.fixed_items | length')
   ESCALATED_COUNT=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.escalated_items | length')
   PR_ITERATIONS=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] .pr_comment_review.iterations)
   PR_FIXES=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.pr_comment_review.fixes | length')
   PR_ISSUES=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.pr_comment_review.issues_created | length')
   AUDIT_ISSUES=$(.agents/skills/orch/scripts/workflow-state get [ISSUE_ID] '.audit_issues_created | length')
   ```

2. **Output session summary**:

   <output_format>
